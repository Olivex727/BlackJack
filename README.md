# Oliver Walters' BlackJack
Y12 Term 4 Project

# Rules
- There is a deck of 52 cards
- Each player draws two cards to begin around and bets a certain amount
- Using a double down costs money towards the bet
- When all the players have decided to 'stand' or have 21 on both decks (After a split), the person closest to 21 wins
- Scoring 21 will mean that 150% of the bet is paid out, unless if it came from split aces
- Aces can be 11 or 1. Jack, Queen and Kings are all 10. Number cards have their own values
- The score is calculated by adding up the card values (If having ace = 11 exceeds 21, the ace will become 1)
- The bets are placed on both split decks collectively (If both split decks win, the money is doubled. If both win 21, the money is tripled)
- Splits can be done only before the first hit
- When doubling down, the deck is hit immediately and then goes standing
