# Rules

## Basic Rules
- There is a deck of 52 cards
- Each player draws two cards to begin around and then bets a certain amount
- The basic moves a player can make are Hitting (Draw a card) and Standing (Fold on move)

## Winning the game and Scoring
- When all the players have decided to 'stand' or have 21 or more on all hands, the round ends
- Scoring 21 will mean that 150% of the bet is paid out, unless if it came from split aces
- Aces can be 11 or 1. Jack, Queen and Kings are all 10. Number cards have their own values
- The score is calculated by adding up the card values (If having ace = 11 exceeds 21, the ace will become 1)

## Betting and Doubling Down
- A minimum bet of 5 dollars is required
- Using a double down costs money towards the bet, it will double the bet and then it will hit and stand the deck
- When doubling down, the deck is hit immediately and then goes standing
- Bets can be placed only when the initial two cards have been dealt

## Splitting
- The bets are placed on both split decks collectively (If both split decks win, the money is doubled. If both win 21, the money is tripled)
- Splits can be done only when the card has two idetical number cards

## Controls
